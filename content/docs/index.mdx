## Database and its Classification

A database is a structured collection of data that allows us to store, fetch, and manage data.

Databases can be categorized in two main ways: by storage medium (where data is physically stored) and by data model (how data is structured).

    ### Based on Storage Medium

        1.  Disk-Based Databases

            - These databases store data on physical disks, such as Hard Disk Drives (HDD) or Solid State Drives (SSD).
            - Data persists even after system restarts, making them durable by default.
            - Retrieval is slower than in-memory databases due to disk input/output (I/O) operations.
            - Examples:PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL.

        2.  In-Memory Databases

            - These databases store data in RAM (Random Access Memory) for rapid access.
            - Offer near-instant retrieval speeds due to RAMâ€™s fast access times.
            - Ideal for applications needing real-time performance, like caching or analytics.
            - Can be configured for persistence but prioritize speed over durability.
            - Example: Redis.

        > Redis Insight: Redis is an in-memory database, leveraging RAM to deliver exceptional speed for read and write operations, which makes it perfect for time-sensitive applications.

    ### Based on Data Model

        The data model determines how data is organized and accessed within a database.

        1. SQL Databases

        - Known as relational databases, they use tables with rows and columns to store data.
        - Data is connected via relationships (e.g., foreign keys).
        - Best for structured data with well-defined relationships.
        - Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL.

        2. NoSQL Databases

        - These databases use non-tabular formats to store data, accommodating unstructured or semi-structured data.
        - Include subtypes like:
          - Key-Value Stores: Simple key-value pair storage (e.g., Redis).
          - Document Stores: JSON-like document storage (e.g., MongoDB).

## What is Redis ?

Redis, short for Remote Dictionary Server, is an open-source, in-memory key-value database.
Unlike traditional databases limited to basic data types, Redis is often called a
"data structure store" because it supports advanced data types like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and more.

## Key Features of Redis

    - Speed: By storing data in RAM, Redis achieves lightning-fast read and write operations.
    - Persistence: While primarily in-memory, Redis offers persistence options (e.g., snapshots or append-only files) to save data to disk.
    - Rich Data Structures: Supports diverse types like lists, sets, and sorted sets.
    - Scalability: Can scale horizontally with clustering to handle large workloads.
    - Pub/Sub Messaging: Enables real-time messaging through publish-subscribe functionality.

## Common Use Cases

    - Caching: Speeds up applications by caching frequently accessed data.
    - Session Management: Stores user session data for quick retrieval in web apps.
    - Real-Time Analytics: Processes high-speed data for analytics or leaderboards.
    - Queues: Keep Record of Jobs in Queue.

## Conclusion

Redis stands out as an in-memory key-value database, leveraging RAM for unparalleled speed and making it a go-to choice for real-time applications like caching and session management.
